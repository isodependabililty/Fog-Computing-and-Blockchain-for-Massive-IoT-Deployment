Fog Computing and Blockchain for Massive IoT Deployment

The traces are structured as follows:

[Execution time] [Energy consumption] [Total packets]

Execution time : Total processing time within a fog node

Energy consumption : Total energy concumtion by the fog

Total packets : sum of the successeful packets * packet size

Compute the network utilization:
Network utilization =  Total packets/ Execution time
